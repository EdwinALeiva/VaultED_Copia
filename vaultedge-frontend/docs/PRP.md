# VaultEdge Frontend – Product Readiness & PRP

Date: 2025-08-12

## Scope

This document summarizes the changes delivered today for VaultEdge’s frontend, covering UX, reliability, and security-adjacent items that improve product readiness.

## Highlights

- Import Folder UX
  - Robust folder selection using the File System Access API with fallback to input (webkitdirectory)
  - Per-file conflict resolution with Replace / Keep both / Skip, plus “Apply to all”
  - Progress and Cancel housed in the popup only (no duplicate controls)
  - Capacity pre-checks to prevent over-quota imports
- Upload/Replace/Download
  - Consistent cancellable operations with progress
  - Pre-upload capacity validation; replacement checks account for size deltas
- Safe Box creation & metadata
  - Security type (single/dual key) and capacity selection
  - Dashboard uses selected capacity; preferences persisted per safebox
- UI/Usability
  - Cleaner sidebar and dashboard; denser file table with sky-blue zebra striping
  - Smaller font in FileTree; active folder emphasized; refined breadcrumbs
- Reporting & Notifications
  - “Report a Bug” page with environment capture and session drafts
  - Session activity log export to PDF; optional session summary emails (simulated)

## Key Components & Services

- `src/components/SafeBoxDetail.jsx`
  - Centralized file ops: upload, replace, download, import, delete, rename
  - Per-file import conflict modal (apply-all supported)
  - Capacity checks via `ensureCapacityForDelta`
  - Drawer for preview/metadata
- `src/components/FileTree.jsx`
  - Folder tree with compact typography and active folder emphasis
- `src/services/storageApi.js`
  - Aborts via `AbortController`; progress callbacks
- `src/services/emailService.js`
  - Simulated notifications and session summary emails

## Security & Reliability

- Frontend relies on backend CSP, XSS headers, stateless sessions, and BCrypt hashing
- Global exception handling on backend prevents information leaks
- Client-side guards reduce failed ops early (capacity checks and validations)

## Validation

- Lint/build: clean
- Manual smoke tests performed:
  - Folder import with conflicts (Replace/Keep both/Skip and Apply to all)
  - Subfolder import validation when Include subfolders is off
  - Cancel during import/upload/replace shows only in popup and aborts correctly

## Known Limitations / Next Steps

- Storage endpoints currently demo-oriented; secure integration pending
- Version history and per-file audit are placeholders
- Real email delivery not yet wired (currently simulated)
